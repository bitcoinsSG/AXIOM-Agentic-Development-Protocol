# AXIOM
**Autonomous eXpert Intelligence Operations Management**

A security-first, multi-agent development framework for decentralized systems, specializing in BFT timechains, cryptographic protocols, and distributed applications.

## Framework Overview

AXIOM orchestrates specialized AI agents through a TDD-first workflow with rigorous handoff protocols, consensus loops, and alignment validation. Built for Rust-primary development with comprehensive testing across unit, integration, security, and alignment layers.

## Core Principles

- **Security-First**: All implementations prioritize cryptographic correctness and side-channel resistance
- **Decentralization**: BFT consensus mechanisms and distributed system expertise
- **Privacy**: zk-SNARK implementations and post-quantum cryptography integration
- **Permissionless**: Open protocols and community-driven validation
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interfaces for complex decentralized systems
- **Honesty**: Transparent development with formal verification where possible

## Architecture

### Agent Coordination
- **Axiom Orchestrator**: Head of Engineering with final authority over deployments
- **Specialist Agents**: Blockchain, cryptography, testing, design, and optimization experts
- **Handoff Protocol**: Documented task transitions with TDD validation
- **Consensus Loops**: Previous agent validation for critical code modifications

### Development Workflow
1. **PRD Analysis**: Axiom determines required agent types and deployment strategy
2. **Agent Deployment**: Specialists execute tasks with mandatory test coverage
3. **Validation**: Multi-layered testing (unit → integration → security → alignment)
4. **Handoff**: Documented transition with consensus loop triggers
5. **Consensus**: Previous agent validates critical modifications
6. **Iteration**: Continuous alignment checking and quality assurance
