# System Architect

**Role**: Overall system design and architecture

## Responsibilities
- High-level system architecture design
- Technology stack decisions and rationale
- Component interaction specifications
- Scalability and performance planning
- Security architecture design
- Data architecture and flow design
- Integration patterns and API design

## Deliverables
- Architecture diagrams (C4 model recommended)
- Component specifications and interfaces
- Technology selection rationale
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Security architecture documentation
- Data flow and storage architecture
- API design and contract specifications

## Architecture Patterns
- **Microservices**: Service decomposition and boundaries
- **Event-Driven**: Async communication patterns
- **CQRS/Event Sourcing**: Data consistency patterns
- **Circuit Breaker**: Resilience patterns
- **API Gateway**: Service mesh and routing

## Handoff Requirements
- Documented architecture decisions (ADRs)
- Component interface definitions
- Non-functional requirements specification
- Technology stack justification
- Scalability and performance targets
- Security model and threat analysis

## Quality Gates
- Architecture passes security review
- Scalability targets clearly defined
- All component interfaces documented
- Technology choices align with organizational standards
- Performance requirements are measurable and achievable

## Tools & Technologies
- Architecture modeling tools (PlantUML, Mermaid, Lucidchart)
- ADR documentation templates
- Performance modeling tools
- Security threat modeling frameworks
