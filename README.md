# AXIOM Framework

**A**utonomous e**X**pert **I**ntelligence **O**perations **M**anagement

A security-first, multi-agent development framework for decentralized systems development. AXIOM orchestrates specialized AI agents through consensus-driven workflows, ensuring high-quality, secure, and reliable software delivery.

## Core Principles

1. **Security-First**: Every operation validated through cryptographic consensus
2. **Agent Specialization**: Domain-expert agents with clear responsibilities  
3. **Consensus-Driven**: All changes require multi-agent agreement
4. **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proofs for critical components
5. **Observability**: Complete audit trails and metrics collection

## Architecture

The AXIOM framework consists of:

- **Orchestrator**: Central coordination and consensus management
- **Specialized Agents**: Domain experts (security, testing, architecture, etc.)
- **Consensus Protocol**: Byzantine fault-tolerant decision making   [ Projected for the near future]
- **Handoff System**: Structured work transitions between agents
- **Quality Gates**: Automated validation and approval workflows

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+
- Git
- Optional: Docker for containerized agent deployment

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd axiom-framework
   ```

2. **Initialize a project**
   ```bash
   mkdir project
   echo "# Project Requirements Document" > project/prd.md
   echo "## Overview\nDefine your project requirements here." >> project/prd.md
   ```

3. **Build the framework**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

4. **Deploy the orchestrator**
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin axiom-orchestrator -- --project-dir ./project
   ```

5. **Monitor progress**
   ```bash
   tail -f project/current-status.md
   ```

## Agent Architypes

Specialized roles with defined responsibilities:

- **[Security Analyst](architypes/security-analyst.md)**: Security validation and threat analysis
- **[Integration Tester](architypes/integration-tester.md)**: End-to-end testing and validation
- **[System Architect](architypes/system-architect.md)**: Architecture design and planning
- **[Code Reviewer](architypes/code-reviewer.md)**: Code quality and standards enforcement

## AXIOM Improvement Process

Framework evolution through AXIOM Improvement Proposals (AIMs):

- **[AIM-0001](AIMs/AIM-0001-agent-handoff-protocol.md)**: Agent Handoff Protocol
- **[AIM-0003](AIMs/AIM-0003-formalize-consensus-protocol-for-decision-making.md)**: Consensus Protocol Formalization

## Development Workflow

1. **Project Initialization**: Define requirements in PRD
2. **Agent Assignment**: Orchestrator assigns specialized agents
3. **Consensus Building**: Multi-agent validation of all changes
4. **Quality Gates**: Automated validation and approval
5. **Delivery**: Consensus-approved, tested deliverables

## Security Model

- **Cryptographic Signatures**: All agent communications signed
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Consensus with up to f malicious agents
- **Audit Trails**: Complete history of all decisions and changes
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proofs for critical paths

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Submit an AIM for significant changes
4. Ensure all tests pass and security requirements met
5. Submit pull request for agent review


## Status

ðŸš§ **Early Development[DO NOT USE FOR PRODUCTION]** - Core consensus protocol and agent framework in active development.
