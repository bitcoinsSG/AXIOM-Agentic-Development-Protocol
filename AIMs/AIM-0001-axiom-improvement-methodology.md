# AIM-0001: Axiom Improvement Methodology

This document defines the Axiom Improvement Mechanism (AIM), a structured, evolutionary approach to refining and extending the AXIOM Agentic Development Protocol. Each AIM follows a consistent format and targets changes that fall into one of three categories:

1. **Removal of Feature** (Natural Selection)\
   Eliminate an existing component or behavior deemed unfit or obsolete.

2. **Modification of Feature** (Random Mutation)\
   Alter an existing component to improve performance, maintainability, or alignment.

3. **Addition of Feature** (Adaptive Augmentation)\
   Introduce a new component or capability to expand functionality or resilience.

### AIM-0001: Evolutionary Selection Formal Guidance

**Status:** Draft\
**Date:** 2025-08-03\
**Category:** Meta-Process Definition

**Objective:**\
Establish the formal guidance and template for AIM proposals. Define the lifecycle of an AIM from conception through approval and integration.

**Scope:**\
This AIM applies to all subsequent improvement proposals for the AXIOM framework. It ensures consistency, traceability, and clear categorization of changes.

#### 1. Proposal Template

```markdown
# AIM-XXXX: <Title>

**Status:** (Draft | Under Review | Approved | Rejected)  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Category:** (Removal | Modification | Addition)  

**Background:**  
Brief context and rationale for the proposed change.

**Description:**  
Detailed specification of the change, including affected modules, agents, and workflows.

**Motivation:**  
Why this change is necessary. Cite metrics or scenarios illustrating current limitations.

**Impact Analysis:**  
- **Dependencies:** Affected components or prerequisites.  
- **Risks & Mitigations:** Potential pitfalls and proposed safeguards.  
- **Metrics for Success:** Quantitative or qualitative measures to evaluate effectiveness.

**Implementation Plan:**  
Step-by-step actions, assigned roles, and estimated timeline.

**Review & Approval:**  
Checklist for peer review, testing requirements, and final sign-off.
```

#### 2. Workflow Lifecycle

1. **Drafting:** Author creates an AIM document in `/aims/AIM000X-<title>.md`.
2. **Review:** Assigned agents (e.g., cryptographer, performance tester) perform assessments.
3. **Consensus Voting:** Orchestrator runs a consensus loop (pBFT-inspired) to accept or reject.
4. **Merge & Integration:** Approved AIMs are merged; CI pipeline enforces tests aligned with the change.
5. **Monitoring:** Meta-Orchestrator tracks key metrics for post-integration validation.

#### 3. Directory Structure

**Next Steps:**

- Place this document in `/aims/AIM0001-Evolutionary-Selection-Protocol.md`.
- Create AIM0002 through AIM0006 covering each recommendation from the protocol critique:
  1. Test-Coverage Thresholds (Modification)
  2. Consensus Protocol Formalization (Addition)
  3. Ontology for Handoff Documents (Addition)
  4. Security Axioms Registry (Addition)
  5. Meta-Orchestrator Design (Addition)
