# AIM-0006: Meta-Orchestrator Design

**Status:** Draft  
**Date:** 2025-08-03  
**Category:** Addition

**Background:**  
Current orchestration lacks adaptive coordination and process optimization based on performance metrics. The existing orchestrator operates with static parameters and cannot dynamically adjust to changing project conditions, team performance, or coordination failures.

**Description:**  
Implement a Meta-Orchestrator agent that monitors cross-agent performance metrics and dynamically adjusts consensus frequency, team composition, and workflow optimization based on real-time feedback loops.

**Motivation:**  
Prevent coordination failures, optimize development velocity, and enable self-improving development processes through adaptive feedback mechanisms. Current static orchestration may lead to local optima and emergent coordination failures that reduce overall system effectiveness.

## Detailed Specification

### Meta-Orchestrator Responsibilities

#### Monitoring & Analysis
- Monitor consensus latency, success rates, and dissent patterns across all agents
- Analyze agent performance metrics and identify bottlenecks in real-time
- Track development velocity trends and quality regression patterns
- Detect coordination antipatterns (thrashing, deadlock, excessive rework)
- Collect and analyze handoff failure rates and causes

#### Adaptive Optimization
- Dynamically adjust consensus thresholds based on project criticality and risk
- Recommend team composition changes for optimal skill coverage
- Modify workflow parameters to improve throughput and quality
- Trigger escalation procedures for persistent coordination failures
- Implement A/B testing for process improvements

#### Feedback Control Systems
- Implement dampened feedback loops to prevent oscillation
- Use statistical analysis to validate optimization effectiveness
- Maintain rollback capability for changes that decrease performance
- Provide transparency in all optimization decisions

### Data Structures

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
struct MetaOrchestrationMetrics {
    consensus_latency_p95: Duration,
    consensus_success_rate: f64,
    agent_utilization: HashMap<AgentType, f64>,
    handoff_failure_rate: f64,
    development_velocity: f64,
    quality_regression_rate: f64,
    coordination_failures: u32,
    rework_percentage: f64,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
struct AdaptationStrategy {
    consensus_frequency: ConsensusFrequency,
    team_composition: HashSet<AgentType>,
    quality_thresholds: QualityThresholds,
    escalation_triggers: Vec<EscalationCondition>,
    workflow_parameters: WorkflowConfig,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
enum ConsensusFrequency {
    EveryChange,
    CriticalChangesOnly,
    TimeboxedBatches(Duration),
    AdaptiveThreshold(f64),
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
struct EscalationCondition {
    trigger_metric: MetricType,
    threshold: f64,
    duration: Duration,
    action: EscalationAction,
}
```

### Adaptive Algorithms

#### Performance Analysis Engine
```rust
impl MetaOrchestrator {
    fn analyze_performance_trends(&self) -> PerformanceAnalysis {
        // Statistical analysis of metrics over time
        // Identify significant performance degradations
        // Correlate metrics with recent configuration changes
        // Generate optimization recommendations
    }
    
    fn detect_coordination_antipatterns(&self) -> Vec<AntiPattern> {
        // Identify circular dependencies in handoffs
        // Detect excessive consensus rounds on minor changes
        // Flag agents consistently voting against majority
        // Identify bottleneck agents causing delays
    }
}
```

#### Optimization Strategy Selection
```rust
impl AdaptationEngine {
    fn select_optimization_strategy(&self, 
        current_metrics: &MetaOrchestrationMetrics,
        historical_data: &[MetricsSnapshot]
    ) -> AdaptationStrategy {
        // Multi-objective optimization considering:
        // - Development velocity
        // - Quality maintenance
        // - Resource utilization
        // - Risk management
    }
}
```

### Feedback Control Loop

#### 1. Metrics Collection Phase
- Gather performance data from all active agents
- Collect consensus round statistics and outcomes
- Monitor handoff success/failure rates and timing
- Track resource utilization across the system

#### 2. Pattern Analysis Phase
- Apply statistical analysis to identify significant trends
- Correlate performance changes with recent adaptations
- Identify bottlenecks and coordination failures
- Generate actionable insights and recommendations

#### 3. Strategy Adaptation Phase
- Evaluate proposed changes against success criteria
- Implement changes within predefined safe bounds
- Document rationale for all optimization decisions
- Schedule review and rollback windows

#### 4. Validation and Testing Phase
- A/B test new strategies against current baseline
- Measure statistical significance of improvements
- Validate that changes don't introduce new failure modes
- Collect agent feedback on workflow changes

#### 5. Rollback and Learning Phase
- Automatically revert changes that decrease overall performance
- Update machine learning models with results
- Document lessons learned for future optimization
- Share insights with development community
