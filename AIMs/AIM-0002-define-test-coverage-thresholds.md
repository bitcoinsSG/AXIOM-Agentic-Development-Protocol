# AIM-0002: Define Test Coverage Thresholds

**Status:** Draft\
**Date:** 2025-08-03\
**Category:** Modification

**Background:**\
Establish quantitative coverage goals to ensure agent outputs meet quality standards.

**Description:**\
Specify minimum coverage percentages for each agent role (unit, integration, security, alignment). Embed coverage checks in CI.

**Motivation:**\
Uniform coverage thresholds reduce regression risk and provide clear quality targets.

**Impact Analysis:**

- **Dependencies:** Orchestrator reporting, coverage tools.
- **Risks & Mitigations:** Overly high thresholds may block merge; adjust iteratively.
- **Metrics for Success:** % of PRs meeting thresholds, reduction in post-merge defects.

**Implementation Plan:**

1. Define threshold values.
2. Update CI config.
3. Communicate to agent roles.
4. Monitor coverage metrics.

**Review & Approval:**\
Peer review by testing and devops agents.
