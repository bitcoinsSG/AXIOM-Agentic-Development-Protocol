## Recent Decisions & Changes

### Architecture Decisions Record (ADR)

#### ADR-001: Rust as Primary Language (2025-08-01)
**Decision**: Use Rust for all core framework components  
**Rationale**: Memory safety, performance, strong cryptographic ecosystem  
**Status**: [x] Approved

#### ADR-002: HotStuff for Consensus (2025-08-02)  
**Decision**: Evaluate HotStuff-rs vs custom BFT implementation  
**Rationale**: Need proven BFT consensus with formal guarantees  
**Status**: [ ] Under Review

#### ADR-003: Agent Archetype Model (2025-08-03)
**Decision**: Comprehensive agent specialization with clear handoff protocols  
**Rationale**: Enables expert-level automation while maintaining coordination  
**Status**: [x] Approved
